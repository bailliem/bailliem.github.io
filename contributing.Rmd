We very much appreciate contributions to the TensorFlow for R blog from the broader R community. If you are interested in publishing some of your own work or insights, we'd love to hear from you! 

Articles posted on the TensorFlow for R blog are authored using [Radix for R Markdown](https://rstudio.github.io/radix). Here are the steps required to contribute a new article:

1. Create a [GitHub repository](http://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html) to host your article (we'll use the repository for feedback and review of the post before it's published).

2. Create a new [Radix article](https://rstudio.github.io/radix) and check it into the GitHub repository (be sure to check in the the Rmd source code and the generated HTML files).

3. Be sure that you've included all required [article metadata] (see below for details).

4. [Post an issue](https://github.com/rstudio/tensorflow-blog/issues) on the TensorFlow for R GitHub repo requesting that we accept your article (be sure to include a link back to your article's GitHub repo!).

Once we see your issue we'll take a look at your article, suggest changes as necessary, then publish it when it's ready.

### Article metadata

To be included in the blog, your article should include some standard metadata fields. Here's an example of a post that includes all required metadata:

  Using Keras to train a convolutional neural network to classify physical
  activity. The dataset was built from the recordings of 30 subjects 
  performing basic activities and postural transitions while carrying a 
  waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.
